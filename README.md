# Iris_flower_classification
Iris flower classification is a common machine learning problem involving the identification of iris flowers into three species based on their features. The dataset typically includes sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width measurements. Machine learning models, like decision trees or support vector machines, are trained on this data to classify iris flowers into setosa, versicolor, or virginica species. The accuracy of the model is assessed through techniques like cross-validation, and it is used as a fundamental example for introductory machine learning and classification tasks. Accurate iris flower classification is important for botany and ecological studies.
